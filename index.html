                    <h2>Customer Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Customer privacy is important to us at <b>PRWireNow.com</b> (the “website”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). We provide both manual and automated services for PR agencies and businesses to upload documents to the website and submit them as press releases for distribution to press wire websites that are integrated with or without us (the “Service”). We treat all information collected by or transmitted to us with care, particularly personally identifiable information, and this Policy describes how, when, and why we collect such information. Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify, contact, or locate an individual. This may include, but is not limited to, forename, first name, ID, passport number, address, email, credit/debit card details, financial data, and other contact information. Any information that does not enable identification, location, or contacting of an individual, such as aggregated information, is also covered by this policy.</p>
                    <h2>Consent, Notification, and Modification</h2>
                    <p>The Privacy Policy governs personal information collected for the Website’s purposes and information provided to us as a data processor for our clients.</p>
                    <p>Upon using the Website, you authorize us to collect your Personal Information to the extent necessary to manage your account and improve the services and information we send you. This information can be sent to any entity that contributes to the service provided to you, such as those responsible for the execution of our service.</p>
                    <p>Using our Services does not give us any rights to your Personal Information beyond those necessary to provide the Services.</p>
                    <p>In addition, as a recipient of our service, you commit to providing appropriate notice of your privacy practices to, and obtaining the necessary permissions and consent from, any third parties with whom you engage and/or whose Personal Information is collected, received, used, and/or disclosed by us.</p>
                    <p>To meet legal and regulatory obligations, personal information is stored for security purposes. You have the right to access, rectification, and opposition to your Personal Information. This also includes a right to unsubscribe from emails that will be sent to you from time to time.</p>
                    <p>In our discretion and subject to the applicable law, we reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy. Any amendment shall be effective within 15 days following the posting of the changed Policy on our Website, and your continued use of the service shall constitute consent to the terms and conditions of the amended Policy.</p>

                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Our service may also use “cookies” and other tracking technologies to collect Anonymous Information. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about service activity and it may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated, such as user ID and password for access to the service.</p>
                    <h2>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>We will store your Personal Information in our system and use it for the following purposes only:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managing the administrative aspects of the services, supporting you, handling complaints, and contacting you.</li>
                        <li>Enforcing this Policy and the Terms and Conditions, preventing misuse of the Website, complying with legal requirements, assisting competent authorities, and taking action in case of a dispute involving you with respect to the service we provide.</li>
                        <li>Improving the Website and the services, developing new services, and improving the accuracy and reliability of the services.</li>

                    <p>We do not sell, license, lease, or otherwise disclose Personal Information to any third party for any reason, except as described above. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third parties where required by law to regulatory, law enforcement, or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies or when necessary to protect our rights or property in accordance with the applicable law.</p>
                    <p>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage in another related business to help us carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, delivery, and safekeeping as indicated in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
                    <p>Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose. All third parties with whom we share personal information are required to protect personal information in the same way we protect personal information and according to the new EU data protection regulations (“GDPR”), if applicable. Examples of private information shared are identifying information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and information on account activity.</p>
                    <p>Suppose you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company/individual at any time. In that case, any personal information you share with it will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to, and we have no control over the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded website or a linked website, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by that third party.</p>
                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This is done by using physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information. We do not store Personal Information for longer than necessary to provide the service or as permitted by law. Though we implement measures to reduce the risks of damage, loss, and unauthorized access to Personal Information, they do not provide absolute information security. Therefore, it is not guaranteed, and one cannot reasonably expect, that the service will be completely immune from any unauthorized interceptions or access.</p>
                    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>This privacy policy may be changed from time to time, as we see fit and where the changes are required by the GDPR or any other applicable law. The most updated version is the binding version posted on the site. We may inform you via email regarding any material changes.</p>
                    <h2>Complaints</h2>
                    <p>If you do not think that we have processed your data following our policy, please contact us in the first instance, at the details shown in the website’s ‘Support Tickets’.</p>
